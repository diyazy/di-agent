**Context-Aware Agent for Decentralized Edge Orchestration**

Implementation artifact for the dissertation *A Context-Aware Agentic Framework for Decentralized Edge Computing* (Tampere University, Diyaz Yakubov, supervised by David Hästbacka and Sergio Moreschini). Funded by Business Finland — Industry X and 6GSoft projects.

## What this is

`di-agent` is an autonomous orchestration agent designed for resource-constrained edge nodes (Raspberry Pi 4 and equivalent). It makes context-aware task scheduling and offloading decisions without a centralised control plane.

The agent's decision logic is driven by the **Semantic Map** — an adaptive behavioral data structure that starts from scientifically grounded priors (derived from five empirical publications) and continuously refines its knowledge with live deployment telemetry. As observations accumulate, decisions shift from generic literature knowledge toward deployment-specific behavioral patterns, without labeling or manual tuning.

The implementation is organized around a contract-based architecture: six swappable interfaces (Collector, Storage, Ontology, Updater, Reasoner, Proposer) allow the same agent binary to run on a Raspberry Pi (`edge-minimal` profile) or a cloud VM (`cloud-full` profile) by changing a single startup flag.

## Research context

This repository covers **Publications P6 and P7** of the dissertation:

| Publication | Title | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| P6 | Semantic Map & Context-Aware Agent Architecture | In progress |
| P7 | Decentralized Agentic Framework (P2P coordination) | Planned — Year 3 |

The agent synthesises findings from five prior publications:

| Publication | What it contributes to di-agent |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| P1 — [Performance & Resource Efficiency](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-84617-5_7) | Initial priors: pod-startup latency, throughput constants per distribution |
| P2 — [Security, Resilience & Maintainability](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-84617-5_8) | Initial priors: security compliance scores, recovery time constants |
| P3 — Di-Select Orchestration Selection Framework | Backbone topology: 7 constructs, 15 causal propositions (P1–P15) |
| P4 — Energy Analysis (DVFS / CPU microarchitecture) | Initial priors: J/pod, mJ/op, interrupt amplification ratios |
| P5 — Overhead Decomposition (k0s cgroup analysis) | Initial priors: per-component CPU overhead fractions |

## Status

Early implementation — contracts, edge-minimal daemon, and prior initialization pipeline are in active development. Code will be published here as P6 matures toward submission.

## Quick start

```bash
cd semantic-map/go
./dev.sh demo              # 3-minute guided tour: build, graph, 12 scenarios, UI
./dev.sh replay list       # inventory of the dissertation's 225 Netdata parquets
./dev.sh replay run --kd k0s --test idle --run 1 --speed 0   # replay one parquet
```

See [`semantic-map/README.md`](semantic-map/README.md) for the full structure, API, and operational guide; [`semantic-map/ARCHITECTURE.md`](semantic-map/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design record (contracts, profiles, multigraph, externally-driven replay path).
