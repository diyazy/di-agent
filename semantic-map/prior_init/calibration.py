Proposition and construct calibration.

For each of the 15 Di-Select propositions, we compute a PriorStrength λ ∈ [0,1]
using the Spearman rank correlation between the source construct proxy score and
the target construct proxy score across the 5 benchmarked distributions.

Methodology
-----------
1. Assign each distribution a normalised score [0,1] on each construct,
   derived from published empirical constants and computed CSV results.
2. For each proposition (FromConstruct → ToConstruct, Positive|Negative):
   - Compute Spearman ρ between from-scores and to-scores.
   - λ = |ρ|  (strength only; direction is fixed by the proposition polarity).
   - Clip to [0.30, 0.90] to avoid extreme cold-start weights.
3. Return per-distribution construct scores and per-proposition λ values.

Construct proxy variables
-------------------------
PS  – Performance & Scalability:  inverted pod-startup latency + throughput
SC  – Security & Compliance:       CIS security score
RR  – Reliability & Resilience:    inverted recovery time + offline preservation
MU  – Maintainability & Usability: inverted setup time
RC  – Resource Constraints & Cost: inverted energy_per_pod_j + inverted cp_overhead_w
CO  – Connectivity & Offline:      offline_preservation + inverted cp_amplification
CE  – Community & Ecosystem:       normalised GitHub stars
